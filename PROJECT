a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. This
project has many features which are generally not available in normal
library management system like facility of user login and a facility of
teachers login. It has also a facility where student after logging in their
accounts can see list of books issued and its issue date and return date
and also the students can request the librarian to add new books by filling
the book request form. The librarian after logging into his account i.e.
admin account can generate various reports such as student report issue
report teacher report and book report.

the systems into a user friendly manner. The Library Management
System (LMS) acts as a tool to transform traditional libraries into digital
